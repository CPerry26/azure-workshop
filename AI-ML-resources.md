### Cognitive Services
Infuse your apps, websites, and bots with intelligent algorithms to see, hear, speak, understand and interpret your user needs through natural methods of communication. 

#### Vision
Image processing algorithms to smartly identify, caption, and moderate your pictures.

##### [Computer Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/)
Extract rich information from images to categorize and process visual data, and use machine-assisted moderation of images to help curate your services. Analyze an image, automatically read text in images, read handwritten text, recognize celebrities and landmarks, analyze video in near real-time, generate thumbnails, and more.

* [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/home)
* [API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/)
* [SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/)

##### [Content Moderator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/content-moderator/)
Machine-assisted moderation of text and images, augmented with human review tools.

###### Image Moderation 
Enhance your ability to detect potentially offensive or unwanted images through machine-learning based classifiers, custom blacklists, and optical character recognition.

###### Text Moderation
Helps you detect potential profanity in more than 100 languages and match text against your custom lists automatically. Content Moderator also checks for possible personally identifiable information (PII).

###### Video Moderation
Enable the scoring of possible adult content in videos. Video moderation is currently deployed in preview on Azure Media Services.

###### Human Review Tool
Humans can effectively augment machine learning models in situations where the prediction confidence warrants assistance or when decisions must be tempered with a real world context. Enjoy visibility, flexibility and control with a human review tool that supervises the results of your algorithms.

##### Emotion API
Personalize user experiences with emotion recognition. Analyze faces to detect a range of feelings and personalize your app's responses. The Emotion API takes a facial expression in an image as an input, and returns the confidence across a set of emotions for each face in the image, as well as bounding box for the face, using the Face API. If a user has already called the Face API, they can submit the face rectangle as an optional input.
